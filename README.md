Whether you’re working from home or in the office, the workstation (desktop/tabletop) will be of the same conditions. 
Even the computer will be running on the cloud server, allowing for seamless continuation of work progress, without the difficulty of needing to ‘set up’ the workspace every time you’re shifting from office to home.
Integrated ‘cloud Kanban board’ will show the tasks on the screen/board, controlled by a stylus pen or keyboard, and will be reflective on both the cloud table in the office as well as at home.
Team members working on the same tasks will also be able to see changes on the board in real-time
Security will also be addressed, given that the devices are linked on the cloud, and hence, more could be done such as connecting the devices to user’s mobile device to alert on any changes/unauthorized use of workstation (some other future possible developments)
